 /*Discuss the difference between for loop,foreach loop, and do-while loop in PHP.
   ans.
   =>for loop:
   The for loop is commonly used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of code. 
 
   =>foreach loop:
   The foreach loop is specifically used to iterate over arrays.

   =>do-while loop:
   The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the block of code will run at least once before checking the condition.
