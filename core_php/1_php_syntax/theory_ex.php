/*1. Discuss the structure of a PHP script and how to embed PHP in HTML.
  Ans.
  PHP is an embedded scripting language when used in Web pages. This means that PHP code is embedded in HTML code. You use HTML tags to enclose the PHP language that you embed in your HTML file — the same way that you would use other HTML tags. You create and edit Web pages containing PHP the same way that you create and edit regular HTML pages.
  
  The PHP language statements are enclosed in PHP tags with the following form:
  <?php      ?>

/* 2.What are the rules for naming variables in PHP?

  -variables never asign with whitespace.
