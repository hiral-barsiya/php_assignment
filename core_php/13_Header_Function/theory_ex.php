/* What is the header function in PHP and how is it used ? 
    ans:
    The header() function in PHP is used to send raw HTTP headers to the client . HTTP headers are sent to the browser before any actual content is displayed, and they provide important metadata about the request or response. The header() function allows you to manipulate the HTTP response headers, such as redirecting users, controlling caching behavior, setting content types, and more.
